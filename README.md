# Keyglow: keyboard highlighter

Keyglow is a React application designed to create visual guides for keyboard shortcuts. Whether you're guiding, sharing or teaching something that requires pressing keyboard shortcuts, this app helps you visually highlight keys on a virtual keyboard and download an image with the result.

New keyboards are about to be added:

- A better-designed keyboard I made [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/carlostxrres/pen/VwqKbzM).
- Versions of the current keyboards, but with in different languages and distributions.
